# Gleam PGO

A PostgreSQL database client for Gleam, based on [PGO][erlang-pgo].

[erlang-pgo]: https://github.com/erleans/pgo

```gleam
import gleam/pgo
import gleam/dynamic
import gleeunit/should

pub fn main() {
  // Start a database connection pool.
  // Typically you will want to create one pool for use in your program
  let db = pgo.connect(pgo.Config(
    ..pgo.default_config(),
    host: "localhost",
    database: "my_database",
    pool_size: 15,
  ))

  // An SQL statement to run. It takes one int as a parameter
  let sql = "
  select
    name, age, colour, friends
  from
    cats
  where
    id = $1"

  // This is the decoder for the value returned by the query
  let return_type = dynamic.tuple4(
    dynamic.string,
    dynamic.int,
    dynamic.string,
    dynamic.list(dynamic.string),
  )

  // Run the query against the PostgreSQL database
  // The int `1` is given as a parameter
  let assert Ok(response) =
    pgo.execute(sql, db, [pgo.int(1)], return_type)

  // And then do something with the returned results
  response.count
  |> should.equal(2)
  response.rows
  |> should.equal([
    #("Nubi", 3, "black", ["Al", "Cutlass"]),
  ])
}
```

## Installation

```sh
gleam add gleam_pgo
```

## Atom generation

Creating a connection pool with the `pgo.connect` function dynamically generates
an Erlang atom. Atoms are not garbage collected and only a certain number of
them can exist in an Erlang VM instance, and hitting this limit will result in
the VM crashing. Due to this limitation you should not dynamically open new
connection pools, instead create the pools you need when your application starts
and reuse them throughout the lifetime of your program.

## SSL options and CA Certificates

`gleam_pgo` supports two main modes of SSL: `SslEnabled` and `SslVerify`. The
latter is the most secured form of SSL, checking every signatures against the
system-wide CA certificates provided by the OS.

You can easily enable one or the other using `ssl: SslEnabled` or
`ssl: SslDisabled` in `pgo.Config`. `sslmode` is also supported in configuration
URI. The different values allowed are `disable`, `require`, `verify-ca` and
`verify-full` (as specified in Postgres documentation).

Below a little bit more explanations on SSL if you need to understand better
what's happening, and some common problems.

### A word on SSL connections

Every SSL connection should be setup using an SSL certificate. An SSL certificate
is notably made of a signature of a Certificate Authority (CA), and a public key.
Those two parts allow to establish the secured connection as well as checking
the validity of the certificate. When opening a connection with a server secured
with SSL, the server will send the certificate, and every data will be
subsequently sent encrypted with a private key that can be decrypted using the
public key of the certificate. However, we cannot trust a certificate, because an
attacker can create a certificate on its own. That's where the signature comes into
play: the signature of the CA cannot be easily compromised. When a client
receives an SSL certificate, it will first check the CA signature against a list
of known authorities, and if one of them match, it means the SSL certificate
can be trusted.

### What does it mean for Postgres?

Therefore, it's possible to use an SSL connection with different modes:
accepting SSL, but skipping verification of CA certificate, and accepting
SSL _and_ verifying CA certificate. Most of the time and when in critical
environment, you should _always_ verify the CA certificate. However, some
situations can ask to disable that layer of security, mainly because of
self-issued certificates.

One common situation is when using a managed version of Postgres, for instance
on Digital Ocean or AWS RDS. Those managed services are powerful hosted services
of Postgres, but to avoid spending money on SSL certificates, they prefer issue
their own certificates. It means they created a custom CA certificate, and they
issue SSL certificates for databases with that custom CA certificate. Because
that certificate is not in your default environment, setting a connection with
`SslVerify` _will_ fail, because BEAM will not be able to check the validity of
the certificate. All it will be able to do is guaranteeing the connection is
encrypted with SSL. Switching to `SslEnabled` can suffice, especially if your
instance is secured in your VPC. However, you're still a potential target for a
man-in-the-middle attack.

### Solving the CA certificate issue

To solve the custom CA certificate problem, what is needed is to provide the CA
certificate itself, to check the SSL certificate of the database against it.
`gleam_pgo` tries to solve the problem in an elegant way. Instead of having to
grab the certificate and handle it in your application code, `gleam_pgo` will
read the certificates from your OS, using Erlang function
`public_key:cacerts_get()`.

#### Adding the custom CA certificate in your OS certificate chain

Adding the CA certificate depends on your OS:

##### Linux

CA certificates are managed through the `ca-certificates` package.
Every common installation of Linux have it already installed, excepted Alpine.
Once the package is installed, you should get the certificates you want to add
in `.pem` format to the system, and put it in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates`,
with a `.crt` extension. Run `update-ca-certificates` and voilÃ ! Your
certificate is added in the certificate chain!

Be careful though, a PEM file can contains _multiple_ certificates. In that case,
you can simply split the PEM file in multiple CRT files,
[like suggested on ServerFault](https://serverfault.com/questions/391396/how-to-split-a-pem-file),
or you could simply push all certificates in the certificate chain by hand! All
`update-ca-certificates` will do is concatenating certificates in
`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`. A simple `cat my-certificates.pem >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` will do the trick! Be careful though, everytime the OS will
run `update-ca-certificates` by itself, you'll have to redo the operation. In such
cases, it's recommended to add the certificates in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates`,
but it could be useful in case you building a Docker image for example!

##### macOS

CA certificates can simply be added on the system using the keychain! Double-click
on the certificates, and let macOS work for you!

##### \[Reminder\] Shape of a PEM certificate

A PEM certificate looks like this: (example taken from an AWS `eu-west-1` certificate)
